# Information-theoretic-Security-Cryptography-Code-Set

Information-theoretic security (also known as unconditional security) is a type of cryptographic security that is based on mathematical principles rather than computational complexity. In information-theoretic security, it is proven that an attacker with infinite computational power cannot break the encryption, rather than relying on the fact that the encryption is too difficult to break with current computing technology.

One example of information-theoretic security is the one-time pad. The one-time pad is a simple encryption scheme that provides perfect secrecy, meaning that it is mathematically impossible for an attacker to determine the plaintext from the ciphertext, even with infinite computing power. The one-time pad is based on the principle of XOR (exclusive or) operations and uses a truly random key that is as long as the message being encrypted.
